.RB [ \-F
.IR re ]
.RB [ \-t
.IR file ]
.RB [ \-p

.RB [ \-f
.IR file ]
.RB [ \-v ]
.RB [ \--help ]
.RB [ \--dump-script ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cwatch
monitors a system log for interesting information.   It attempts to
be a clone of the well-known
.B swatch
program as much as possible, but without having to drag masses of
.I perl
modules into your system.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c file
Use 
.B file
as the configuration file.  If you don't specify a configuration
file,
.B cwatch
attempts to open
.IR $HOME /.cwatchrc
and if that fails, it uses the builtin configuration of
.nf
watchfor /.*/
    echo
.fi
.TP
.B \--help
Displays usage information, then exits.
.TP
.BI \-F re
Log records are separated by 
.I re
instead of by newlines.
.TP
.B \-V
Display the version information, then exit.
.TP
.BI \-t file
Examine lines of text as they are added to 
.IR file .
(This is the same as
.IR "\-p cat\ file" )
.TP
.BI \-p command
Examine input piped from
.IR command .
.TP
.BI \-f file
Do a single pass through
.IR file ,
doing everything except 
.B throttle
actions.
.TP
.B \--dump-script
For debugging only.  Display the (parsed) contents of the configuration
file, then exit.
.PP
If 
.B cwatch
is called without any input option, it defaults to
.IR "\-t /var/log/syslog" .

.SH THE CONFIGURATION FILE
.B cwatch
attempts to closely follow the format of the
.B swatch
.RI ( v3 )
configuration file, but is not quite the same.

A configuration file is made up of a series of patterns with
actions associated with them.  The patterns are either

.TP
.BI watchfor\  regex
If the pattern is seen, do the associated actions.
.TP
.BI ignore\  regex
If the pattern is seen, do nothing with it.  
.PP
Unlike
.BR swatch ,
.B cwatch
only accepts a single pattern regex per pattern, so common
.B swatch
expressions like
.nf
ignore /foo/,/bar/,/fu/
.fi
are isallowed;  you need to rewrite them as
.nf
ignore /foo|bar|fu/
.fi

.B watchfor
patterns take a collection of actions 
.RB ( "quoted"
strings MUST be quoted with double-quotes, unlike 
.BR swatch ,
where text can be tossed in any old way.)
.TP
.B echo\ [modes]
Echo the matched line.  The text mode may be
.IR normal ,
.IR bold ,
.IR underscore ,
.IR blink ,
.IR inverse ,
.IR black ,
.IR red ,
.IR green ,
.IR yellow ,
.IR blue ,
.IR magenta ,
.IR cyan ,
.IR white ,
.IR black_h ,
.IR red_h ,
.IR green_h ,
.IR yellow_h ,
.IR blue_h ,
.IR magenta_h ,
.IR cyan_h ,
and/or
.IR white_h .
The
.I _h
colors specify a highlighting color.
.TP
.B bell\ [N]
Ring the terminal bell 
.BR N (default=1)
times.
.TP
.B exec\ \"command\"
Execute
.IR command .
The 
.I command
may contain variables which are substituted with fields from the
matched line.  A 
.I $N
will be replaced by the
.IR N th
filed in the line.  A 
.I $0
or 
.I $*
will be replaced by the entire line.
.TP
.B mail\ [addresses=to:to:...][,subject=\"text\"]
Send mail to
.I address(es)
containing the matched lines as they appear.  If you don't give addresses
to mail the letter to, it will be sent to the user who is running the
program.)
.B pipe\ \"command\"\ [,keep_open]
Pipe matched lines into
.IR command .
.B keep_open
forces the pipe to stay open until a different pipe action is run or
until swatch exits.
.TP
.B write\ [user:user:user]
.B write(1)
the matched lines to 
.IR user(s) .
.TP
.B throttle\ hours:minutes:seconds\ [,use=message|regex]
Limit the number of times that the matched pattern has actions performed
on it.  Once a command is
.BR throttle d,
nothing except 
.B continue
takes effect until after the delay given.
.TP
.B continue
Causes
.B cwatch
to match other patterns after it is done with the current one.
.TP
.B quit
.B cwatch
cleans up and exits.
.PP
All of these options except
.B quit
also take the
.B when
argument;
.TP
.B when=days:hours
Only perform the action on the specified days and hours. for example
.nb
.B "bell 10 when=1-5:4"
.be
means that the 
.B bell
command only runs at teatime on weekdays.

.SH BUGS
The 
.B echo
modes are not yet implemented.

The 
.I use=
option for 
.B throttle
doesn't work, because I can't make heads or tails out of what it's
supposed to do.

.B write
is not yet implemented.
