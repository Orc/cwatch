This is my attempt at doing a swatchalike in C; it implements, fuzzily,
about 95% of what the perl version does (at least as far as I can
interpret the documentation & the perl source of the original.)

I am not a system administrator anymore (I administer a few machines
scattered around, but they're the standard Linux style of being boxes
without users, just service providers) so I don't use this code much
myself.  But I think it's still useful on the occasional time I need to
have some sort of log sweeper running.
